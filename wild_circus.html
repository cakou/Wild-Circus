			<section id="acrobats">

				<h2>Acrobatics</h2>

	<p> Aerial acrobatics likely originated with the practice of tightrope dancing at medieval fairs. They encompass all disciplines requiring the rigging of an apparatus at a height, e.g., a bar, rope, trapeze, silk, etc. With the exception of tightrope performers, aerial acrobats use the force of their arms and hands to lift or move their own body or that of their partners. Catchers or flyers perform at a height in a fixed position, or while swinging or flying. Aerial hoops, rings, chains or straps are among the aerial acrobatic apparatus used.

			<section id="clown">

				<h2>Clown</h2>
					
	<p>Derived from the English comedy of pre-Shakespearean times, the clown was originally a comic character, a country jester. Clowns first appeared in equestrian and acrobatic burlesque, and then became broadly comic and grotesque characters within pantomime and circus shows. Clowning arts combine acting, mime, farce and slapstick to create sketches that make audience laugh. The first famous pantomime clown was Joey Grimaldi (1778-1837). </p>

				<h2>Horse riding</h2>

	<p>The aerobatics on the track are reserved for the show.
It is not a work of individual enhancement, but the learning of a partnership: two beings who team up.
The aerobatics is practiced in a track of 13 meters in diameter. The horse at a gallop is directed by a master of the merry-go-round to the voice and the chamber-maid. The fielder performs acrobatic figures on the horse: flic-flac, courbettes, jumps, ...
The goal is that the fielder and the horse become one and find their balance, being at the service of each other. </p>
